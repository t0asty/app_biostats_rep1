```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
treemoist <- read.delim("treemoist.txt", header=FALSE, sep="")
colnames(treemoist) <- c("species", "branch", "location", "transpiration", "moisture")
tm.aov <- aov(moisture ~ species * branch * location * transpiration, data=treemoist)
```

## Introduction

## Exploratory Data Analysis

## Model Fitting

## Model Assessment

Do the model assumptions hold?

```{r, echo=FALSE}
layout(matrix(1:4,ncol=2))
par(pty="s",mar=c(3,1,2,1)+0.1)
plot(tm.aov)
```



## Conclusions




## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
